       "GPT: Artificial Intelligence, commonly abbreviated as AI, refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence to accomplish. AI is a rapidly growing field of technology that has the potential to revolutionize almost every aspect of our lives.\n",
       "\n",
       "In its most basic form, AI can be thought of as the ability of a computer system to think, learn and make decisions much like a human being does. This is achieved through the creation of algorithms, analytical systems, and machine learning models that are designed to identify patterns and trends in data and use that information to make informed decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "One important aspect of AI technology is machine learning, which is a process whereby computer algorithms improve their performance on a specific task by processing large amounts of data. These algorithms are designed to recognize patterns in data and use that knowledge to make complex decisions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Today, AI technology has a wide range of practical applications. For example, AI-powered voice assistants such as Siri and Alexa have become common features of smartphones and smart homes, while AI-powered chatbots are transforming customer service by providing instant support to customers 24/7. Other uses of AI include fraud detection, image and speech recognition, and personalized advertising.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite the many benefits of AI, concerns have been raised about its potential to replace human workers in certain industries. However, it's worth noting that AI technology is still in its infancy, and its long-term effects are yet to be fully understood. One thing is certain - AI has the potential to transform the way we live and work in ways that we can only begin to imagine.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, AI is a complex and rapidly advancing technology that has the potential to revolutionize the world as we know it. By combining data analysis with machine learning, AI systems can learn and make decisions as if they were human, with applications ranging from chatbots to fraud detection. While there are concerns about the impact of AI on the future of work, its many benefits make it an exciting technology to watch into the future."

    "- Temperature: A hyperparameter that influences the randomness of LLM output. A high temperature produces unpredictable and creative results, while a low temperature generates common and conservative output.\n",
    "- Top p: A hyperparameter that sets a probability threshold to select the most likely tokens for LLM output. By considering the top tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold, this method can create more diverse output. For example, setting top p to 0.9 only randomly samples from the most probable words that make up 90% of the probability mass. A high value means less candidates a low value means more candidates.\n",
    "- Frequency penalty: A penalty term applied to the generation process of a language model to avoid repeating words or phrases excessively. By adding a frequency penalty, the model is encouraged to generate text that is more diverse and avoids repetitive output.\n",
    "- Presence penalty: Another penalty term that discourages the model from generating specific words or phrases. By assigning a high penalty value to certain words or phrases, the model is less likely to use them in the generated text. This can be useful when generating text that needs to avoid specific words or phrases, for example, in sensitive or restricted domains.\n",

Additional AIs such as Stable Diffusion and DALLE will be utilized in the image generation section. These AIs function as math functions using a transformer architecture composed of artificial neurons. They break sentences into tokens and predict the next token based on previous ones. While anthropomorphisms like \"thinking\" or \"brain\" are used often to describe them, they are complex mathematical models that do not accurately reflect how the human brain works. Although neuroscience has advanced significantly, the workings of the human brain remain largely a mystery."
